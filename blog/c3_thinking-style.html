    <h3>April 5th, 2015 The Cultural Assignment about Thinkin'</h3>
     <p>
      We're here to talk about our thinking styles. According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this</a> test, I have the following thinking style.
      <ul>
       <li>12  Concrete Sequential</li>
       <li>40  Abstract Sequential</li>
       <li>32  Abstract Randon</li>
       <li>32  Concrete Randon</li>
      </ul>
      I think what this means, essentially, is that I am a multimodal thinker. I think what this means in the parlance of the test is that I am a big thinker who loves abstraction and theory, thrives in an unstrctured and people oriented environment, and experiments often as a means to find solutions. I say that's pretty accurate. Especially the part about my loving abstraction and theory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within the context of this thinking style, my biggest struggle makes a whole lot of sense. It actually struck me as I was reflecting during this blog and I thought to myself, "wow, maybe there's something to this thinking style test."
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest problem for me in this entire thing has been to give meaning to my effort: What does it mean that I am doing this? What purpose does it serve? What does it say about me, and is it worth while? These questions fit squarely into the realm of theory and abstraction. It's a realm I love, but one that can cause some internal struggle.
     </p>
     <p>
      This insight hits home, and it begs the question: how can I help myself with these questions? One might suggest that I pursue these questions to their conclusion. The problem with this is that there often isn't one; sometimes these big questions don't really have an answer. The fact is that I don't know what this all means. And what scares me the most is that sometimes I think that not knowing means that it doesn't "fit" within my vision of who I am and how I want my life to be.
     </p>
     <p>
      So let's say it doesn't fit. Let's say that DBC is not who I am, and doesn't fit in with how I envisioned myself living my life.  Is that a bad thing?
     </p>
     <p>
      DBC asked me to contemplate a fixed versus growth mindset. Fixed mindset Bo might get depressed over the fact that this wasn't part of his life plan. Fixed mindset Bo might have considered quitting, and going back to what was familiar and comfortable. Fixed mindset Bo might have gotten stuck in an endless mental loop about how he is who he is and coding just isn't a part of him, but isn't it weird that sometimes he kind of likes it, and what happens if he quits now and figures out later that he should have stayed? But he is who he is and coding just isn't a part of him, but isn't it weird that sometimes he kind of likes it, and what happens if he quits now and figures out later that he should have stayed? But he is who he is...
    </p>
    <p>
       This loop is something I cannot stop. But what I can do is introduce another loop. The growth mindset Bo loop. Growth mindset Bo might adopt an endless mental loop about how he doesn't know what the future holds, but that he will make the best of it and be okay, about how he has really grown to like coding and experiences a little thrill every time he solves a problem, about how the pople he's met seem so nice and a lot like him, and isn't it funny that this humanistic/artistic/neurotic person is able to meet people like him doing coding of all damn things, which he is going to do professionally (hopefully) soon, and that might be good or it might be bad, but he doesn't know what the future holds, but he will make the best of it and be okay, and he has really grown to like coding and experiences a little thrill...
     </p>
     <p>
      I think the fact that I am changing the way I think about my own thinking is a big sign that Dev Bootcamp is a positive influence and that adopting a growth mindset can not only change my outlook on my experience at DBC, but can help me learn. As a big thinker, I can use that strength to understand new concepts, and see how they might fit in a bigger picture. But as a growth mindsetter, I can start to think a big more concretely, about what's real, about what's here, and about what's happening right in front of me: something pretty cool...
