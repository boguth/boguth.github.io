    <h3>April 25th - Classes vs. Modules</h3>
     <p>
     It's easy to get classes and modules confused. They share many similar characteristics. For example, both classes and modules are identified by capitalizing their first letter. And both contain a bunch of related methods. However, there are key difference.
     </p>
     <p>
      Classes, as you probably already know, are usually created to serve a single purpose. If you are modeling a motorcycle, for example, you'd create classes to represent each motorcycle part. You would have a motor class, a wheel class, a seat class, a frame class, and so on. Within each class are methods that define its functionality. A motor class will have an on/off method and a cylinder method. A wheel class will have a turn method and a brake method. These methods determine how each instance of a motor class or wheel class behaves and interacts with other objects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Modules can be looked at as a supporting partner of classes. Like classes, they contain a bunch of related methods. However, these methods aren't intended for a specific object's use. A module's methods can be used across multiple objects and classes. As such, you cannot instantiate a module. There can be no module object that acts as a receiver for module methods.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, a module's methods <em>can</em> be used by other classes objects. The way this is achieved is by adding the module to a class. For example, let's say I have a module that provides a method to add a bunch of metal spikes to something. And let's say I am modeling a medieval knight. I can use that module, called the Spike module, in multiple types of classes. Using the include method, I can add Spike's methods to a flail class, for example. Or a helmet class.
     </p>
     <p>
      The capability modules have to be added to multiple different classes, and therefore used by any number of objects, is a defining feature. The act of adding a modules behaviors to a class is called "mixing in." So you would say that modules have mix-in capability.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second big defining feature of modules is that they provide namespaces. This vague term simply means that they provide a way to distinguish between similarly named methods. For example, if a Smart module has a think method, and a Dumb module also has a think method, the fact that "think" has the same method name isn't a problem. By specifying which namespace (module) think is a part of, the differeing functionalities between Dumb think and Smart think won't be confused.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is a lot of information, and I am still wrapping my head around it. The two resources I've found that have been most helpful in learning about modules and classes are:
