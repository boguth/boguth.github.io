    <h3>April 5th, Arrays and Hashes!</h3>
     <p>
      Ah, arrays. Ah, hashes. Like the four horsemen of the apocalypse - if there were only two horsemen, and if they weren't horesmen but were instead ruby objects, and if they didn't herald the <strong>END</strong> but instead stored things in an easily accessible - arrays and hashes are powerful elements that gallop across the web, bringing about the end of bad data storage.

      Well, I was at least right about one thing. Arrays and hashes do store data in an easily accessible way. Arrays and hashes operate very similarly. To understand them, it's probably easiest to start by showing them.
     </p>
     <code>array=[0,1,2,3,4]</code>
      <p>
        That is an array. But I could just have easily stored strings instead of numbers using the same syntax. For example:
      </p>
      <code>array=["worst","best","wedding dress"]</code>
        <p>
          See? Both of those are arrays, but in one case the array is storing numbers and in the other its storing text. Note that the word array I've put to the left of the equal sign is totally arbitrary. I named it array because that's what we're talking about, but I could have easily called it x, y, z, or the_four_horsemen_of_the_apocalypse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each thing that's stored in array has a position - like kids in a line, the first is the worst, the second is the best, and the third is the one in the wedding dress. To use our most recent example, "hi" is in the first position, "this," is in the second, and so on. pretty clear, right? It would be except that in ruby, an element's position is referred to as its <strong>index</strong>. And, the thing about indexes (indices?) is that they don't start with one. They start with zero. "hi" has an index of 0. "this" has an index of 1, and so on. So 0 is the hero, first is the worst, and second is just second because I say so.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array's indexices can be used to reference what is being stored in that position. So, for example, if I typed:
          <code> array[1] </code>
          The thing being stored at the 1st index would print to the screen. In this case, "this." This format of storing data is really useful, especially with the data is ordered. But what happens if the data you store doesn't go in any sort of order,
