    <h3>April 16th, 2015. Feedback.</h3>
     <p> I find pairing to be a mostly positive experience. Solving a problem with someone, getting to have a-ha moments with them, is rewarding. It's also rewarding to feel useful, to be able to contribute to a person's problem solving effort. In that respect, I love peer pairing.
     </p>
     <p>
      It can be frustrating when your partner is uncommunicative or, at the other end of the spectrum, too communicative. While both are a risk, I have found everyone I have paired with to fall somewhere in the middle, and have enjoyed working with everyone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedback has been an overall positive thing. It has afforded me the opportunity to point out what someone is doing well, as well as voice a complaint when necessary (there's only been on). Moreover, hearing feedback has helped validate my communication style. It feels good to hear than I tend to work well with others.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think pairing is a positive thing. It both confirms positive qualities and points out negative ones. The most difficult part of feedback isn't recieving it, it's offering it. To be effective, feedback must be specific - general impressions are good, but aren't necessarily actionable - and that can be a hard thing to do if you aren't intentionally committing a person's actions to memory.
