    <h3>May 9th - Ruby on Rails</h3>
     <p>
      What is Ruby on Rails? In short, it is a a framework for building websites. What that means is that it is a package of tools designed to make programming web apps easier by making assumptions about what ever dev needs to get started (<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"> Source</a>). It was created by David Heinemeier, who helped build the project management software called Bootcamp, as an extension of the Ruby programming language. Like any other type of extension to the Ruby language, Ruby of Rails is a Ruby Gem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ruby is known for having a community dedicated to open source development. As such, there is a vast pool of open source software RoR libraries that make is easier to build complex sites quickly, which makes Ruby on Rails appealing to startups. Moreoever, "Ruby is known among programmers for a terse, uncluttered syntax that doesnâ€™t require a lot of extra punctuation. Compared to Java, Ruby is streamlined, with less code required to create basic structures such as data fields." (<a href="http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html"> Source</a>)
     </p>
     <p>
      Like the .NET framework, Ruby on Rails follows the MVC (Model View Controller) framework. This configuration means that the model maps to a table in a database, the controller responds to external requests and decides which file to render to a user, and the view evalutes and converts to HTML at runtime, and is displayed to the user.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over 600,000 websites use Ruby on Rails, including Basecamp, Twitter, Hulu, Groupon, GitHub, AirBnB, and Square. An impressive list.
