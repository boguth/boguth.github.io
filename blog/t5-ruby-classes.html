    <h3>April 15th, 2015. Let's talk about classes.</h3>
     <p>
      Classes are collections of methods that ultimately define the behavior and state of an object. In order to make a class, there must usually be 
      two things: Methods that define what an object of that class can do, and methods to set or retrieve the state of the object. 
     </p>
     <p>
       To get a clearer picture of classes and how they work, let's pick something we would want to represent digitally. How about a pie? 
       We write class named with capitalized first letters and define with class and end. <br />
       <br /><code>
         class Pie <br />
         
         end <br />
       </code><br />
       There's our pie class. As I mentioned, we must make some methods that define what a pie can do, and some methods that set or retrieve 
       a pie's state. 
     </p>
     <p>
       What are some things a pie can do?
       <ul>
         <li>It can be eaten.</li>
         <li>It can be sat on.</li>
         <li>It can be placed upon a window sill.</li>
       </ul>
       Ok cool. Now, what are some states it can have?
       <ul>
         <li>Baked.</li>
         <li>Tasty.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
       Nice. Let's put all that in the class. <br /><br />
       <code>
          class Pie<br />
            def baked=(answer)<br />
                puts "Is the pie baked? #{answer}."<br />
            end<br />
            <br />
            def tasty=(answer)<br />
                puts "Is the pie tasty?" #{answer}."<br />
            end    <br />
            <br />
            def eaten<br />
              puts "Your pie has been eaten."<br />
            end<br />
            <br />
            def sat<br />
              puts "Your pie has been sat on."<br />
            end  <br />
              <br />
            def fifties_mommed<br />
              puts "Your pie has been placed upon a window sill."<br />
            end<br />
         end 
       </code> <br /><br />
