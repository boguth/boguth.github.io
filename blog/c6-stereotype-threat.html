    <h3>April 26th - The Stereotype Threat</h3>
     <p>
      I have been lucky to have rarely experienced the stereotype threat. If ever. I can identify one or two times in my life where I have felt prejudged by my appearance or expected to act a certain way because of my background and those few times have been extremely uncomfortable. They made me angry. I cannot imagine having to constantly live under the pressure of stereotypes or prejudice.
     </p>
     <p>
      I can fully understand the impact people's expectations of you can have. We're social creatures and public pressure can have far reaching consequences, as evidenced by the effect stereotypes can have on black students taking tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think my responsibility as a memeber of a non-marginalized group (white males) is to be mindful of my behavior around and expectations of others who may be susceptible to the stereotype threat. Prejudice, and stereotypes, are rarely overt in their application or effects. They are subtle, and sometimes even unintended. Therefore, it seems prudent for me to ensure that I am welcoming and warm to anyone, regardless of race or gender, and to be mindful of any assumptions or expectations I have of others.
