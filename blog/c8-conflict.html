    <h3>May 9th - Conflict</h3>
     <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</li>
        <li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
        <li>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</li>
        <li>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</li>
        <li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
        <li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
      </ol>
     </p>
     <p>
      1. I had a conflict with a pairing partner over whether to use divs or unordered lists. He presented the former, I countered with the latter.<br />
      2. The source of the conflict was over which ideas we presented, and more essentially, pride over which idea was correct.<br />
      3. Upon analyzing the conflict I realized I felt frustrated, because I knew that in this particular situation, that my idea made more sense. I also felt anxious, because I worried that my partner would be defensive if I insisted on my idea.<br />
      4. In order to resolve the conflict, I presented my reasoning. I kept the issue centered on me: "Well, to me it makes sense because..." rather than focusing on his idea.<br />
      5. I don't think I would go back to try anything different on this conflict. By suggesting my reasoning, my partner saw my point of view, and we eventually ended up doing it my way. I felt good about it, not because I was "right," but because the conflict was resolved amicably.<br />
      6. I learned that, often, presenting your side of an idea without adding judgment value - i.e. "I'm right, you're wrong" - can be a valuable technique in a conflict.<br />
