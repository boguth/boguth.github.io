      <h3>second blog post march 21, 2015</h3>
      <p>
      I appreciate the culture fostered by dev bootcamp. It seems that, based on what Shareef said, it was created for the purpose of allowing and encouraging people to add their own spin to what it means to be a developer. This I like, because as a person who considers himself more creative than technical, it seems like I will have room and a place to grow at DBC.

      <p>
        I also like that Dev Bootcamp is not pushing a culture that's highly regimented. I have a knee jerk reaction against organizations which demand a certain behavior, or faux-positive mindset. It's difficult for me to function in an environment where behavior/emotion is enforced. That's not at all what I see in Dev Bootcamp. Whereas some organizations may mandate, Dev Bootcamp suggests. And it seems that everything DBC suggests has a very sound rationale behind it.
     </p>

        Overall, DBC seems to be extremely rigorous in how it preps its students. Morever, I think that it goes about fostering creativity and uniqueness in a progressive way. So far, I am happy with everything I have done with DBC and look forward to more.
