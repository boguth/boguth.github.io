    <h3>Saturday, April 11th. 2015. The tech issues blog.</h3>
     <p>
      There a couple of issues about the tech world that concern me. The first is privacy. The second is the subjugation of the human race by evil robots. Let's start with privacy.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am a big proponent of privacy. When Edward Snowden first revealed the extent of NSA spying, I was at once appalled, but at the same time I was apathetic. It is reprehensible that the NSA spies on American citizens to the extent that they do. It's so bad that they can see anything you type over emails, social media, and text. And yes, that means they can see those pictures of your junk that you sent to your ex-girlfriend one night when you were drunk. Don't believe me? Check out this John Oliver interew with Edward Snowden himself:

     <p>
      The problem is that the government spying on me has no real bearing on my life. It doesn't matter that they see my texts, emails, and selfies of me wearing wacky hats in a gag-gift shop. And I don't think the attitude I have is all that unique. I think that's a big reason why the NSA is able to get away with what it does.
     </p>
     <p>
      I still want to stop it from happening. It's both an issue of principle and practicality. In principle I think I think it's wrong. Practically speaking, I don't want the government to have the potential to manipulate me using my private information. I don't think anyone does. So how do I, and by extension everyone else who finds it hard to care about privacy, bridge the gap between apathy and morality? It's a tough question. On a personal level, I force myself to care, even when it's difficult. I take the time to read about the issue when I can, and when I vote I am sure to vote for politicians who have a record of supporting privacy.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a large scale, I am not sure how to change people's behavior. I do think that John Oliver has the right idea - relating it to something that American's might actually care about (our junk).
    </p>
    <p>
      Well that's about it for me. I have said what I needed to - oh, wait. I forgot to mention the subjugation of the entire human race by evil robots didn't I? It could  happen. I'm serious.
